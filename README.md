# School File Management System
Create an application for a school system using Python to open and process files of different formats, transfer data, fetch information from school webpages, analyze content, and generate summaries for the school principal about students' assessment activities. Implement Exception Handling techniques for controling database accessiblity and connection. Also create and apply your customized dataset.

*School Assessment Data Analysis Application Objective:*
The school administration wants to streamline the process of collecting, analyzing, and summarizing assessment data for the principal. The application should be able to handle various file formats, extract information from webpages, and provide insightful summaries for better decision-making.

System Features:
1. File Processing: Accepts files in different formats such as CSV, Excel, and plain text. Opens and reads the content of the files.
2. Data Transfer: Transfers data between different files based on predefined criteria. Merges data from multiple sources to create comprehensive datasets.
3. Web Data Retrieval: Utilizes the urlopen function to fetch data from relevant school webpages. Extracts assessment information, student scores, and other relevant details.
4. Content Analysis: Analyzes assessment data to identify trends, patterns, and outliers. Generates statistical summaries, class averages, and individual student performance metrics.
5. Summarization: Produces summaries of assessment activities for the school principal. Highlights key insights, areas of improvement, and outstanding achievements.

# Music Streaming App
You are part of a team developing a new music streaming app called "MFun." Your task is to design the core functionality that manages the user's music library and playlist creation. Consider the following requirements:

Music library:
Needs to store a collection of songs and their associated metadata (title, artist, album, genre, length).
Must efficiently retrieve songs by various criteria (artist, album, genre, title).
Must prevent duplicate song entries.

Playlists:
Users can create unlimited playlists.
Each playlist can contain any number of songs, but a song cannot be added multiple times to the same playlist.
Songs can be added, removed, or reordered within playlists.
The app should display songs in the order they were added to the playlist.

Which data structure model(s) would you choose to implement the music library and playlist features? Explain your choices, considering the characteristics of each data structure and the specific requirements of the application.

Data structures to consider: Tuples, Sets, Lists, Dictionaries, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues

## Main Requirement:
1. Create song example
2. Create a music library
3. Add songs to the music library
4. Get songs by artist
5. Create playlists
6. Add songs to playlists
7. Display playlists
8. Searching for songs by artist

## Sample Output:
